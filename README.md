# KArim SHell (KASH)

## How to build
Simple, use makefile. I didn't add a cmake project because this is a POSIX shell, and on POSIX systems, most use make.

## Features
 * Colors!
 * cd
 * history and calling history
 * Displaying user name (Including SUDO)
 * Displaying current work directory (home gets replaced by ~)

## TODO (Maybe)
 * Add support for up and down arrow keys
 * Environment variable support
